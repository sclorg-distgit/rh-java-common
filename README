The %{scl_name} package provides a set of commonly used Java libraries
and tools for packaging Java applications. For more information
about Software Collections, see the scl(1) man page.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} bash

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications which
are not located in the file system root hierarchy but instead are stored in
an alternative location. The location is %{_scl_root} in
case of the %{scl_name} Software Collection.

The primary purpose of the %{scl_name} Software Collection is to provide
support for other Software Collections. These Software Collections may depend
on %{scl_name} and make use of common Java libraries and packaging tools
provided by this collection. The contents of this Software Collection
may change without prior notice.

When you want to start working with the %{scl_name} Software Collection, use the
scl utility to enable the SCL environment. See the scl(1) man page for
usage.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg from within the
  %{scl_name} Software Collection environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} Software Collection
  enabled.
